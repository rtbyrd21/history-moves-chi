It seemed like after that no matter where I went, somebody was always touching me until the age of 14.  I went from being an A student to someone who was always in trouble, fighting, and my grades dropped.  I had been labeled a thief, I had all kinds of names except child of God.  So for me, childhood was I don't know, a give and take kind of situation.  I had some good memories but they are definitely overshadowed by the worst ones.",

There was no discrimination when it came to me being molested.  And again, I still didn't know what to discuss and what not to discuss because nobody had discussed it with me.  From there I went to another babysitter who was my mom’s best friend, her husband, I guess he figured I was 12, I was old enough.  So from the age of 12 to the age of 14 he did that.  And by this time I'm now a molester myself.  He did it to me and I did it to his daughter.  Still, for whatever reason, nobody connected the dots.  I was just a troubled kid.",
